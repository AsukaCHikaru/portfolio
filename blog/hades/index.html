The soundtrack is fantastic on its own, but the synergy with the gameplay is even more amazing.</p><p>(In 2021, I was in the top 0.5% Spotify listener of Darren Korb — the music and sound director of Hades, who wrote and performed all the tracks, and voiced Zagreus, Skelly, and more. He’s so talented it’s insane)</p><p>The majority of the tracks have two sections: the build-up, and the climax. In the earlier stages with fewer foes, it will play the build-up part, then transition to the climax part exactly when the mini-boss or the boss battle begins.</p><p>One of the most notable examples of such change-of-pace may be found in Eurydice’s solo “Good Riddance”. Last second you were fighting out of your way in Asphodel, then the rock music is gone, replaced by classical guitar and Ashley Barrett’s beautiful voice. You would forget you’re still in the underworld.</p><h1>An all-around marvelous game</h1><p>Hades is easy to pick up with its great combat, and it encourages players to challenge themselves through narrative progression. When a player has completed the main story, escaping the underworld should be a breeze, and he or she is ready for the next step: the challenges set by yourself.</p><p>After playing other action games, I realized why I fell in love with Hades so much despite action is not my favorite genre: in Hades, the battle is fair.</p><p>This game provides enough tools for players to overcome challenges. When you fail, you will know where and when you made mistakes. It’s challenging, but it’s fair. The positive loop of self-improvement and progress gain makes it difficult to stop playing this game.</p><p>And I was deeply impressed by the game when playing this game from the beginning for the second time on PS5. From the way the main story unfolds, to every time Zagreus speaks to himself, there are too many “wow” moments delivered by how the game seamlessly links narrative and gameplay.</p><p>I’ve been recommending Hades to folks whenever we’re talking about games for the past six months. This game is so well-polished, it’s almost flawless. To me, it is the one and only Game of the Year.</p><p>Hades is the best game I’ve played in years, and I believe it will stay there for a long time.</p></article></main><footer class="site-footer_container">Asuka Wang © <!-- -->2025</footer></div></div></div>
