The entanglement of these two concerns disrupted the mental model, making the code messy and eventually sabotaged the game.

The mechanic itself is extremely simple: transition between hero turn and mob turn base on hero and mob <strong>AP</strong>, or action point. Move or attack uses AP, and one&#x27;s turn is over when all AP is used. Below is the full list of executions in a combat loop:</p><ol><li>Start in <code>HERO_TURN</code>. Wait for hero <strong>ATTACK</strong> or <strong>MOVE</strong> action.</li><li>When hero <strong>AP</strong> is equal to or less than zero, transition to <code>MOB_TURN</code>.</li><li>In <code>MOB_TURN</code>, mobs in level take action in turn. Each mob checks if hero is in vision if it is in <code>IDLE</code> state. If yes, it transitions to <code>AGGRO</code> state, in which it may <strong>ATTACK</strong> or <strong>MOVE</strong> toward hero. One mob take actions until its <strong>AP</strong> is equal to or less than zero. If no, mob skips turn. <code>DEAD</code> mobs skip turn as well.</li><li>When all mobs have consumed their <strong>AP</strong>, transition to <code>HERO_TURN</code>.</li></ol><p>The hook&#x27;s responsibility is to monitor hero and mobs&#x27; AP and proceed on the state transition.

The transition from <code>HERO_TURN</code> to <code>MOB_TURN</code> only depends on two things:</p><ol><li>AP is no larger than zero.</li><li>It is <code>HERO_TURN</code>.</li></ol><p>Here I used another effect to update <code>turnStateRef</code> instead of directly depending on <code>turnState</code>, as it would make the turn state setting effect depending on turn state itself, a common anti-pattern for React effects.</p><p>Next is the mob turn. The effect does below things:</p><ul><li>only work in <code>MOB_TURN</code></li><li>only work for mobs not in <code>DEAD</code> state</li><li>each mob take action in turn, until all AP is used</li></ul><p>The first two tasks are simple conditions; the third is the main task of this effect. The mob taking action part, however, has been encapsulated in mob state machine; all it requires is just to send a <code>TAKE_TRUN</code> event to them.

The combat loop works with less than 150 lines of code. Compare to the abomination before, this implementation is way easier to read, maintain and test. While XState was not the one to blame, decoupling combat state from it did very much help me constructing a simpler mental model. I&#x27;m also happy that I was able to do this in the React way–makes the tech stack decision meaningful.</p><figure><img src="/public/images/blog/project-fiddlesticks-devlog-2_2.webp.webp" alt="A simpler flowchart with hero and mob states monitored by useTurn"/><figcaption>Flowchart after refactoring. Way simpler and more elegant now.</figcaption></figure><p>With this refactoring, v0.2.1 is a critical bug-free (many minor issues still exist) build that is playable at <a href="https://grapegummygames.itch.io/project-fiddlesticks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://grapegummygames.itch.io/project-fiddlesticks</a>. The gameplay could be rather dull, as it only has the bare-bone components; many features are on the roadmap, including character progression, loot qualities, improved dungeon generation, and more, all of them I&#x27;m looking forward to implement as well as talk about in future devlog entries.</p></article></main><footer class="site-footer_container">Asuka Wang © <!-- -->2026</footer></div></div></div>
