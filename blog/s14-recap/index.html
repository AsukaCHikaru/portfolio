Despite the negative first impression, by the time the finals began, I was quite fond of the song, so I enjoyed the opening ceremony and the players introductions a lot. The sequence of the trophy ascending while Emily Armstrong screaming &quot;<i>This is what you ask for</i>&quot;, Mike Shinoda introducing the finalists, both teams entering the arena with Linkin Park playing in the background, then the audience cheering when Faker walked out, was legendary. In my opinion, this was the best opening ceremony performance in the history of league esports.</p><p>But the finals was even more amazing. Last year Faker did an incredible game-deciding play with Azir on Ruler; when the game is on the line and the margin for mistake is slim, only the best player can face the pressure and turn the tide, and the <i>Shurima Shuffle</i> was exactly such a play. This year the stakes were higher, the situation was more dire; when all hope seemed lost, Faker made tremendous play again—twice, which were the championship-deciding play, and the play before that. It was a true privilege to witness Faker do that on live, to watch him ascend once again.</p><blockquote><span>Once again, when you need someone, when you need </span><span><i>anyone</i></span><span> to stand up, and to show just what this game is all about, it&#x27;s Faker!</span></blockquote><p>It was also unbelievable to witness the narrative unfold. When the <i>Shurima Shuffle</i> happened last year, people tried to find any narrative they could to give the play more weight; this year we had the number one and two play of the year, which happened to be the last two plays of the year. Riot could not pray for a better storyline.</p><h1>Arcane</h1><p>After a long wait, Arcane season two was finally here. I binge-watched season one again before season two was released, and I was as impressed as the first time.
