The Night City's aesthetics were already breathtaking, and given the magnitude, I could not imagine how much work CDPR put in. Six districts, seventeen sub-districts, each has different atmospheres. I also noticed that there was more traffic on the street compared than in 1.0, both pedestrians and vehicles.

The missions were better too: in the main game, gigs and side quests, unless involved certain characters, were one-off go-where-kill-how-much quests, without proper buildup or follow-up. In the expansion even gigs included multiple steps which occurred in different locations, and NPCs sent texts even after the whole quest was wrapped.

Horror is not my favorite genre, so I wouldn't say I enjoyed it, but I appreciate that the developers respected player and made the horror gameplay decently challenging.

Since CDPR had previously announced that there won't be another expansion, it is a matter of fact that, at lease in the game of Cyberpunk 2077, that promise has been broken.

There was a sweet span that I leveled up enough so I didn&#x27;t die to everything immediately, yet there were still many spots to discover. There seemed to be endless points of interest to explore, and I could always find something down the road, be it a boss, a treasure, or a beautiful landscape. By map, indicators and common rules among The Lands Between, From Software crafted a world which invites organic discoveries and wow moments.</p><p>That being said, my time in The Lands Between was not all fun and laugh. My most consistent, strongest emotion during the whole playthrough was loneliness. Being thrown into a hostile world, with highly uninviting aesthetic places or habitants here and there, and the best companions I could hope for were ones who speak in riddle (albeit some were cute girls), all took a toll on me. I was fully aware that souls-likes are not cozy games, but that understanding didn&#x27;t help me being more excited about this game.</p><p>The other huge part of Elden Ring gameplay is the boss encounters, my favorite part of a souls-like game: the process of finding the delicate spacing and timing, the understanding and prediction of move patterns, the planning and execution, all by sweat and blood, and the eventual sense of achievement. Margit, Draconic Tree Sentinel, and Malenia all gave me hours of death and struggle, yet the process was fun.</p><p>I could not say the same for the multiple-foes boss encounters. The Valiant Gargoyles didn&#x27;t make me nostalgic but very annoyed, and the Godskin Duo completely killed my remaining patience for this game. I found <i>zero fun</i> in the gank bosses. I still think there are skills in them, and all these won&#x27;t be a problem if I <i>git gud</i> enough. But it was NOT FUN. After finally beat the Godskin Duo with my +10 mimic tear (which I never leveled until this boss), I had absolutely no sense of achievement but a bad taste in my mouth, and the thought of wanting to get this game over with.</p><p>Later I found that many people share the same feeling with me, which I don&#x27;t know if I should be happy about it. I believe many of them enjoyed the game until they didn&#x27;t. It was truly a shame, because I appreciate all the efforts put into this game and I want to love it, but after my first playthrough, all left for this masterpiece was a bitter memory.</p></article></div><div class="frontpage-side-column"><div class="frontpage-side-column-further-reading"><p>More from<!-- --> <a href="/blog?category=review">review</a></p><div><a href="/blog/bitter-masterpiece" class="frontpage-side-column-post">Bitter Masterpiece<span>I appreciate GOTY winner Elden Ring&#x27;s great design and polished gameplay, but I still have a mixed feeling after.</span><span>August 20, 2025</span></a><a href="/blog/a-redemption-three-years-later" class="frontpage-side-column-post">A Redemption Three Years Later<span>CD PROJEKT RED made a promise about Night City, which they broke.
