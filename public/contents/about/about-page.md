Hello! I'm Asuka. I love creating things.

Currently I work at [LY Corporation](https://www.lycorp.co.jp/en/) as a front-end developer, building web (and occasionally native) applications used by millions of users.

During work I mainly focus on helping my team to create more value more efficiently while being happier.

I believe the most important thing to learn is the ability to learn and reflect, and everyday I strive to embody that and make myself a better human than I was yesterday.

# About me

Video gaming has always been my biggest passion since I was a child, and game design is the reason I fell in love with programming.

I speak fluent Mandarin, Japanese and English. Out of these three, English is my favorite. At the moment I'm learning Spanish, aiming to become proficient in three of the world's most widely spoken languages.

I've always had a deep passion for expressing myself through turning my ideas into reality, which is the major reason why I'm into web development. I also enjoy [writing](https://asukawang.com/blog/blogging-and-digital-gardening).

# About this site

I built this site to serve as:

- a personal archive; a digital time capsule for me to revisit my past self
- a place to share my findings and knowledge for anyone who may find it useful
- a sanctuary of my words that does not depend on any social platform or service; my [digital garden](http://localhost:3000/blog/blogging-and-digital-gardening)
- a laboratory to try any new ideas or tools; my web playground

The current iteration of this site is hosted on GitHub Pages, built with a self-made static site generator based on React, and all its content is written in markdown format, managed with obsidian.
